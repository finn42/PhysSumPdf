	\NewsItem{Performance measurements}
	 February 14-18th, 2023, researchers from University of Oslo's RITMO Centre for Interdisciplinary Studies in Rhythm, Time and Motion visited the \textit{Stavanger Symfoniorkester} and collected measurements during a series of Lydo concert performances. You were one of the performers who volunteered to wear sensors while on stage, and requested a summary of your personal data. The following is a short report showing some of your own measurements, plotted to highlight patterns of interest, as well as a few views of the measurements across the ensemble from the researchers' initial explorations. The information presented is not medical advice, the analyses are for scientific research and are not clinical assessments. You are the only recipient of this report.
