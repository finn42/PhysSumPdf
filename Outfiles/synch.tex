	This figure shows the quantity of motion measured from each participant's physiology sensor in a specific intervals of time, ordered by section. Here it is zoomed into the 30 seconds around the synchronisation taps the orchestra performed during the second Lydo concert, showing the original device time alignment above and the effect of correcting those timings by aligning your taps. (The beginning of Clapping music was also used as a secondary check on signal alignment.) Thank you for tapping along to the beeps! This essential task allows us to study your collective coordination with much greater temporal precision.
